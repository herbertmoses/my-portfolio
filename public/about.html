<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Herbert Moses S J, a 33-year-old professional based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Engineering (2013) specializing in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and a Master’s degree in Engineering (2015) with a focus on Power Systems and Engineering, both from Anna University, Chennai. My academic foundation has laid the groundwork for a thriving career in the ever-evolving technology sector.</p>

<p>I started my professional journey in 2015 as a Book Editor in the e-publishing industry, where I honed my attention to detail and organizational skills over five years. From 2020 to 2023, I advanced to a Project Coordinator role in the ed-tech content delivery sector, where I played a key role in managing projects efficiently while bridging the gap between technical teams and content creators. To further elevate my skills, I pursued a part-time Professional Certification Program in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Teknologi, Malaysia, graduating in 2023. Armed with this knowledge, I transitioned to a Senior Software Development Engineer position at a leading multinational tech firm in 2023, where I currently contribute to cutting-edge solutions in the technology space.</p>

<p>Beyond work, I am an ardent enthusiast of sports and fitness and enjoy spending my leisure time playing the musical keyboard, which serves as a creative outlet. A natural introvert, I find solace and inspiration in solitude, where I can reflect and channel my creativity into both professional and personal pursuits. The ever-growing field of technology continues to fascinate me, fueling my curiosity and drive for continuous learning.</p>
